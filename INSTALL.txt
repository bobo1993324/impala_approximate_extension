is because the initial goal was to reproduce BlinkDB on Impala, but the

This is the install instruction for Impala approimate query extension.

The steps  are:
	1. Setup virtual machines
	2. Install Impala cluster on virtual machines
	3. Install Impala approximate query extension

These steps assume that the user doesn't have anything setup yet. If you
already have an Impala cluster running, you can 

Requirements
	Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS (Host to run Impala server on)
	CDH5.2.1 (Impala version)

	Result on other system or Impala version has not been tested yet.

1. Setup virtual machines
	Install Virtual box. Set up a host with memory greater than 4GB. Install
	Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS on ther virtual machine. Set network type to
	bridged adapter.

1.1 Configure host
	When installing Impala, it is important the Impala doesn't see itself as
	localhost. The general solution is to have a DNS service. The easy solutioin is to modify the /etc/hosts. Run ifconfig to get
	the ip of the machine.
	
	Add line to the end of /etc/hosts/
		<ip> <myhost-1.mynet.myco.com>

1.2 Sudo with no password
	This is required for cloudera manager to install impala on your host.
	
	$ sudo visudo
	and add line to the end:
		<username> ALL=(NOPASSWD: ALL)

2. Install Impala cluster
	Download and install Cloudera Manager at
		http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/downloads/cloudera_manager/cm-5-2-1.html
	on the virtual host.

	Go to website <hostip>:7180 to install impala. 
		Select Core with impala in the cluster type.
		You should also provide the host, username that can sudo
		without password and the username's password.
	
	After this, you would have an working impala on the host your setup. You
	now can log into host, type "impala-shell", and create tables and run
	querys their with impala's standard features.
	
	To add additional Impala nodes to the cluster, you can use the same
	website <hostip>:7180. Remember to correctly setup /etc/hosts so that each
	machine can relate hostname to ip correctly.

3. Install Impala approximate query extension

	3.1 Get code
	3.2 Build and upload user defined functions
	3.3 Install shell
	3.4 Install user defined functions

3.1 Get code

	$ git clone https://github.com/bobo1993324/impala_approximate_extension.git

3.2 Build and upload user defined functions
	
	First go to udf directory and make sure dependant library is installed:
		$ cd impala_approximate_extension/udf
		$ sudo apt-get install cmake g++ libboost1.55-dev

	Download and install Impala UDF development package:
		$ wget
			http://archive.cloudera.com/cdh5/ubuntu/precise/amd64/cdh/pool/contrib/i/impala/impala-udf-dev_2.0.1+cdh5.2.1+0-1.cdh5.2.1.p0.14~precise-cdh5.2.1_amd64.deb
		$ sudo dpkg -i impala-udf-dev<tab>

	Compile:
		& cmake . && make
	
	Upload:
		Impala's user defined functions are loaded in HDFS. So we need to
		upload the build file to HDFS

		$ sudo su impala
		$ hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/impala/udf
		$ hdfs dfs -put build/libblinkdbudf.so /user/impala/udf

3.3 Install shell
	$ cd impala_approximate_extension
	$ sudo ./install.sh

	You can uninstall impala approximate extension with
	$ sudo ./uninstall.sh

	After installation, you should be able to enter approximate extension shell with
	$ ./blinkdb-shell
	The usage of calling blinkdb-shell is exactly the same as calling
	impala-shell 

3.4 Install user defined function
	Enter extension shell:
	$ blinkdb-shell
	
	Then in SQL shell, type:
	$ blinkdbinstall /user/impala/udf
	This will install all user defined function used by the extension. The
	user defined functions are bounded with database. If you switch to another
	database that has not been installed user defined functions, you would
	need to run the above command again.

Now that you have Impala approximate query extension installed. Continue to read README.txt to
learn how to do approximate queries.
